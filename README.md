# Bookstore Inventory Management System-DSA Final Project
## Author: Alejandro Umila
This project is a simple, console-based Bookstore Inventory
Management System created for the Data Structures and Algorithms
lab. It is written in Java and demonstrates the practical
application of fundamental data structures and algorithms,
including LinkedLists, Queues, Sorting, and Searching.
## Features
*   **Add New Books**: Users can add new books to the inventory
    by providing a title, author, ISBN, and price.
*   **Dynamic Inventory Storage**: Utilizes a **`LinkedList`** to
    dynamically store and manage the collection of books.
*   **Display All Books**: Shows a complete list of all books
    currently in the inventory.
*   **Sort Inventory**: Implements a **Bubble Sort algorithm** to
    organize the books alphabetically by title.
*   **Search for Books**: Uses a **Linear Search algorithm** to
    find a specific book by its title.
*   **Order Processing**: Implements a **`Queue`** to manage
    customer book orders in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner.
*   **Interactive Menu**: A user-friendly, menu-driven interface
    for easy navigation and operation.
